<h2>Slave Free Buying Guide</h2>
<p>The Slave Free Buying Guide is meant to introduce consumers to companies, brands and social enterprises that address slavery, forced labor and human trafficking in their supply chains. End Slavery Now researched antislavery policies; supply chains; third-party certifications; prevalence studies in specific industries; and companies’ engagement surrounding slavery, forced labor and human trafficking in order to develop a list of products that you can begin purchasing in lieu of other options.</p>

<p>At End Slavery Now we recognize that the best companies are those that put ethical concerns and social responsibility at the top of their agendas. Fortunately, more and more companies care about broader social issues, including the environment and poverty. For this guide, we’ve narrowed our focus to companies, brands and products that specifically address forced labor, slavery and/or human trafficking. In addition to recommending innovative brands that clearly lead the way when it comes to prioritizing slavery-free goods, we’ve also included traditional companies that are beginning to produce specific goods or product lines without the use of child labor, forced labor or other forms of slave labor. Importantly, much of this recent antislavery effort by traditional companies is a direct response to consumer demands for such products. By highlighting some of the best brands and the positive changes towards slavery-free products, this guide is a tool for those wanting to choose better products.</p>

<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
<p>The End Slavery Now Slave Free Buying Guide is divided into sections based on product type. Most sections include:
<ul>
    <li>A brief explanation of slavery in that particular industry or product chain</li>
    <li>Individual product recommendations, so you know which products you can purchase</li>
    <li>Company rankings in Good, Better and Best categories based on their antislavery policies, supply chain transparency, third-party certifications and engagement</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>One of the most impactful ways normal, everyday people can get involved in the fight against modern-day slavery and human trafficking is to begin purchasing slavery-free goods. When scaled, these purchases create demand for goods produced with audited, slavery-free labor; simultaneously, this shift also shrinks the market for goods produced with forced or slave labor and/or by trafficked humans.</p>
